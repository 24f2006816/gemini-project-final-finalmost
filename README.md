# SubGenius - Premium Subscription Service Demo

## Project Description

SubGenius is a responsive, single-page web application demonstrating a modern subscription-based website. Built with HTML and styled using the popular utility-first CSS framework, Tailwind CSS, it offers a sleek and intuitive user interface across all devices. This project serves as a comprehensive example of how to structure and style a marketing site for a subscription service, complete with a hero section, feature highlights, detailed pricing plans, and a contact form.

## Features

*   **Fully Responsive Design:** Adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes, from mobile phones to large desktop monitors.
*   **Modern UI with Tailwind CSS:** Leverages Tailwind's utility classes for a clean, maintainable, and highly customizable design.
*   **Hero Section:** Engaging introductory section with a clear call to action.
*   **Feature Showcase:** Highlights key benefits and functionalities of the service.
*   **Tiered Pricing Plans:** Presents different subscription options (Basic, Pro, Enterprise) with associated features and pricing.
*   **Interactive 'Subscribe' Buttons:** Placeholder functionality to simulate a subscription process with simple JavaScript alerts.
*   **Contact Form:** A basic contact form to allow users to get in touch.
*   **Smooth Scrolling:** Enhances user experience by providing smooth navigation to different sections of the page.
*   **Mobile Navigation:** A responsive hamburger menu for easy navigation on smaller screens.

## Technologies Used

*   **HTML5:** For the core structure of the web page.
*   **Tailwind CSS (CDN):** For all styling and responsive design.
*   **JavaScript (Vanilla):** For minor interactivity, such as mobile menu toggling and subscription button alerts.

## Getting Started

To view and run this project, simply follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository (or copy the `index.html` content):**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd subgenius-demo
    ```

2.  **Open `index.html`:** Locate the `index.html` file in your file explorer and open it with your preferred web browser. Since all CSS and JavaScript are inlined or loaded via CDN, no build steps are required.

## Usage

*   **Navigate:** Use the header navigation links or the mobile menu (on smaller screens) to jump between sections like Features, Pricing, and Contact.
*   **Explore Pricing:** Click on the "Choose Plan" buttons within the pricing section to see a simple alert indicating a plan selection (demonstration purposes only).
*   **Submit Contact Form:** Fill out the contact form and click "Send Message" (no backend integration; this is a UI demo).
